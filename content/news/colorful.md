-------

It's not the end of the world, it's still the colorful world. I would like to introduce [colorful](http://lab.lepture.com/colorful/) to you.

Colorful is the module I used in [nico](http://lab.lepture.com/nico/), it's not just colors, it's colorful in terminal.

Colorful is a node package for terminal programs and only for terminal. It contains a color module, and a colorful nested logging. Just head over to the [homepage](http://lab.lepture.com/colorful/), and dive into it.
